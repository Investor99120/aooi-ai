# System Architecture

## Platform Definition

`aooi.com` is an AI SEO/GEO Operating System for Independent Commerce Brands.

It helps independent-store brands become understandable, citable, comparable, recommendable and conversion-ready across Google, ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity and future AI shopping agents.

## Data Boundary

Core brand intelligence belongs in `brands/{brand}/`.

Publishing-specific output belongs in `adapters/{platform}/` and `outputs/{brand}/`.

No adapter should own brand truth. No reusable engine should hard-code FriendRedLight.

## Output Review Boundary

The project follows the Bilingual Review Output Rule for human-readable review materials.

When engines or adapters generate English customer-facing copy, strategy text, documentation summaries, SEO/GEO explanations, page copy, FAQ drafts, brand descriptions, content briefs, or adapter output previews, they should place a Chinese explanation immediately after the English text for owner review clarity.

This rule must not be applied inside code files, JSON, YAML, JavaScript, TypeScript, Liquid, HTML, CSS, schema JSON-LD, CLI output, test cases, or other machine-readable files. Structured data formats must remain clean and valid.

Adapter outputs should use Chinese descriptions only in internal review notes unless an output mode is explicitly set to bilingual review. Final customer-facing exports should remain in the target market language by default.

## Brand Onboarding Flow

1. Create `brands/{brand}/brand_profile.yml`.
2. Create `product_facts.yml` with verified and unverified fields separated.
3. Create claim whitelist and blacklist.
4. Create localisation rules.
5. Create semantic map.
6. Build search-intent and content-cluster maps.
7. Generate schema and adapter outputs.
8. Run claim, source-status and fake-review checks.
9. Human reviews generated output.
10. Operator publishes manually through the selected channel.

## FriendRedLight Role

FriendRedLight is the first serviced brand case. It demonstrates how a Shopify independent store can be lifted from product pages into a semantic asset system. The implementation must remain reusable for future brands under `brands/{new_brand}/`.

## Shopify Role

Shopify is a publishing adapter only.

Shopify adapter output may include page briefs, FAQ blocks, JSON-LD snippets, product-page copy suggestions, and internal-link recommendations. It must not publish automatically in Phase 1.

## Prohibited System Behaviour

- No fake reviews.
- No invented product facts.
- No medicalised claims.
- No automatic Shopify publishing in Phase 1.
- No hard-coded FriendRedLight logic in reusable engines or adapters.
- No customer-facing output from `unverified` or `needs_owner_confirmation` fields.

## Current Stage

Phase 1.5 is documentation and configuration only. Complex application code, scraping pipelines, generated Shopify pages and live theme changes are intentionally out of scope.
